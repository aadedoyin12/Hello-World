# Hello-World
Well...this should be fun

Deebot here...

I Started learning how to program in my first year of college and my first language was c++...
Then I moved to java in my third year...
Currrently learning web design at freecodecamp and hoping to be fluent in python soon enough...

...I'm just like everyone else, I don't know what I'm doing but at least, I'm doing it;
...AND IT FEELS GOOD!!!
